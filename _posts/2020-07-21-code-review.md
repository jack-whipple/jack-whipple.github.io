A code review is an examination (peer review) of a program that attempts to find and fix mistakes that a developer may have written during the initial stages of development. The code review can focus on many different things, but usually focuses on topics such as  functionality, structure (consistency, formatting, complexity/simplicity), documentation (readability and maintenance), variables, performance (arithmetic operations, and loops and branches), error and exception handling, unit testing, and security. Code reviews are very important as they serve a vital role in catching and fixing programming errors, and help developers improve their skills.

Below is my personal code review for my three chosen artifacts that are listed as Software Design/Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases. Throughout this video I reviewed three different programs I developed in my Computer Science program looking for both good and bad points, and then explaining how I was going to ehanced each program for the purpose my CS 499 class and this ePortfolio.
