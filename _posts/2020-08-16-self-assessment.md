<h3><p align="center">Professional Self-Assessment</p></h3>

The purpose of this narrative is to reflect on the artifact I selected for this category and the process I experienced in creating and it. Throughout this narrative I will 
describe the artifact I selected, explain why its inclusion in my ePortfolio is justified, how I am meeting course outcomes with this artifact, and finally reflect on the process 
of creating this artifact and share the lessons and challenges I had while working on this project.

##### Describe the Artifact
The artifact I chose for this category is called SlideShow and is a java program that combines Java and JavaScript. This artifact comes from the SNHU class CS 250: Software 
Development Lifecycle. I originally created this artifact in 2019, and it was designed for a scenario in which I was tasked with building a slideshow for a travel agency that 
allowed users to view a top 5 vacation destination list. The original program opened a window in which a user could use previous and next buttons to view the top 5 most requested 
vacation destinations. The program was designed with JPannels to hold the image and text that described the top 5 destinations and buttons at the bottom of the window allowed a 
user to navigate forwards or backwards through the slideshow.

##### Justify Artifact Inclusion
I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it aligns with algorithm and data structure principles. This program uses multiple data structures to store data such as URL 
addresses, button and slide data and more, and the algorithms in this program manipulate that data to performing actions based on step by instructions which leads to final output 
of the slideshow program. This artifact specifically shows my ability to expand on previous algorithms and data structures to create a more complex program. It also shows my 
ability to think about the logic in my program to ensure important statements, variables, and structures and methods are all properly included, declared, and defined to create a 
program free of errors. The main enhancement I made to this artifact is that I expanded the complexity of the program by adding a new data structure and algorithm. The expanded 
complexity and functionality were achieved by adding a new button to take the user from the slide they are on to its respective website, and I increased the slideshow from the 
top 5 destinations to the top 10 destinations.

##### Course Objectives
The enhancement I made to this artifact has met course objectives that I had planned on in the ePortfolio selection journal. The enhancement I implemented demonstrates my 
ability to program solutions to solve logic problems in software. This was specifically addressed by the code in this program that uses a FOR loop combined with IF…ELSE 
statements to allow the “Website” button to open the URL of slide the user is on in a new blank window. The enhanced artifact also demonstrates my ability to use innovative 
skills and techniques for implementing design solutions. This was demonstrated by ability to declare URLs as string variables so that I could use the variable in the FOR loop 
for my goLink() method. This allowed me to keep my code clean and efficient. I have included more coverage in potential design flaws related to security by including more 
exceptions, but there could be more addressed in this area.

##### Artifact Reflection
I have learned a lot while making the enhancement to this artifact. While working on the enhancement for this artifact I learned more about expanding on data structures 
and algorithms, and about finding new ways to implement code and my ideas. I learned that my plan and idea for making enhancements was very close to the actual code I had to 
include. This made me feel more confident in my ability to handle complex yet relatively simplistic straight forward code. It was wonderful to see my code execute and perform 
mostly as expected. I say it performed mostly as expected because I have some behavioral work to do on this program to make it a final polished product. The biggest challenges 
I encountered was creating the algorithm that would execute my goLink() function for the new “Website” button. At one point I almost abandon the new button and decided to put 
a link in the name of the destination with an html <a></a> tag. This would have been very easy and simple to do, but I felt that was not really an enhancement to this program 
and did not show any new skill/ability from me in working with algorithms and data structures. Therefore, I am glad I stuck to my dedicated “Website” button. The only issue 
now is that the website button only opens a link to the number one destination in the slideshow and does not open a new window for the current slide in the slideshow. I am 
still unable to fix this issue, and while it means the artifact isn’t 100 percent complete, it still shows my ability to use data structures and algorithms, and proves that I 
have a solid foundation on computer science topics, but still require more development experience. Overall, I was very happy to see the program was free of errors and executed 
properly with the small exception of my “Website” button. It is imperative a computer science professional understands algorithms and data structures, especially in a program 
like this that focuses on web development for users.
