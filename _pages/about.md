I'm a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University. Since entering the program I have learned a lot of new skills and concepts, and I have come to really enjoy working with Linux, and databases. I am now an aspiring database designer/developer, and look forward to becoming a database administrator after several years of experience.
